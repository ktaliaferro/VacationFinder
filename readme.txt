Vacation Finder
by Kenny Taliaferro

This web app uses Twitter data to recommend vacation destinations based on the user's interests and can be found at http://www.vacationfinder.xyz.  It comes pre-loaded with 40 destinations and the Twitter timelines of Twitter users who have tweeted about going to these destinations on vacation.  When the user of the app inputs interests, the app searches the storted Twitter timelines those interets.  The current data set contains about one million tweets.

Scripts in the data_collection folder were used to gather the Twitter data and store it in a MySQL database.

Files in the webapp folder are used to run the app.

The app uses Python, MySQL, and Flask.
